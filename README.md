# ANZ CSV Export Cleaner
I wanted to be able to import my CSV file's into [Goodbudget](https://goodbudget.com/). The CSV files from ANZ have a bunch of extra fields that Goodbudget can't handle. This produces a clean CSV file from these ANZ CSV's to make it easy to identify transations in Goodbudget.
